# ESP8266 Stepper Driver Module Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to control a stepper motor using an ESP8266 microcontroller with a stepper driver module. Stepper motors are commonly used in projects requiring precise rotational control, such as robotics, CNC machines, and 3D printers.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Stepper Motor**
- **Stepper Driver Module (e.g., A4988, DRV8825)**
- **Power Supply for Stepper Motor (if required)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (optional)**


#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Stepper Driver Module to ESP8266:**
   - **STEP Pin:** Connect to a GPIO pin (e.g., D1) on the ESP8266.
   - **DIR Pin:** Connect to a GPIO pin (e.g., D2) on the ESP8266.
   - **MS1, MS2, MS3 (if applicable):** Set to appropriate logic levels for microstepping (if supported).
   - **GND:** Connect to the ground (GND) of the ESP8266.
   - **VMOT (Motor Power):** Connect to the motor power supply (e.g., 8-35V DC).
   - **VCC (Logic Power):** Connect to the 3.3V or 5V output of the ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Include the AccelStepper library for controlling the stepper motor.
   - Define GPIO pins connected to the STEP and DIR pins of the stepper driver module.
   - Define the number of steps per revolution for your stepper motor.
   - Initialize the AccelStepper object with the stepper driver type and pin assignments.
   - Set the maximum speed and acceleration of the stepper motor.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the main loop, move the stepper motor 360 degrees (1 revolution) clockwise.
   - Wait for the motor to reach the target position using `runToPosition()`.
   - Delay for 1 second.
   - Rotate the stepper motor 360 degrees counterclockwise.
   - Delay for 1 second.

#### Applications
- **Robotics:** Control robot joints and movements.
- **CNC Machines:** Positioning of axes for milling, cutting, or engraving.
- **3D Printers:** Precise control of extruder and bed movements.

#### Notes
- **Microstepping:** Adjust the MS1, MS2, MS3 pins for microstepping if supported by your stepper driver.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure the stepper motor and driver module are powered adequately for reliable operation.
